# final_exercise
This repository documents the final exercise of module 1 (R learning track)

# dataset and justification
We first chose to work with the iris data set, given its simplicity, but 
we eventually discarded it because it had already been cleaned (which render it
unfit for this exercise). We then switched to the airfield data set which 
contained several missing values.
